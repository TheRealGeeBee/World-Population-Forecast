# World-Population-Forecast
This repository contains a notebook that describes world population for the year 2029 using population data gathered in 2020.
Data Science is amazing because we can get so much information from data (which is so readily available everywhere). With data visualization, the ride is more fun.

In the images, it would be readily seen what the population of most countries would likely be if it continues to grow at the current rate. For one, India could be the most populous country on earth by 2029!

Go and find your country in the notebook!
